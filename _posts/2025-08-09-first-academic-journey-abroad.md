# Overview

Kyoto, a city steeped in history and culture, was the perfect destination for my first academic conference and my first trip to Japan.
The event was held at the Kyoto University, a leading institution in transportation engineering.
As one of the most renowned conferences in the field, it attracted experts and scholars from around the world.

I was honored to present my research on individual mobility modeling in metro systems, aiming to improve public transportation operations and enhance personal service quality.
In addition to my poster presentation, I attended various speeches and poster sessions, gaining valuable insights into the latest research and trends.

Beyond the academic activities, I took time to explore the beautiful city of Kyoto.
I visited historical sites, museums, and natural attractions such as Kiyomizudera Temple, Kyoto Railway Museum, and Togetsukyo Bridge.
I also enjoyed the local cuisine, sampling dishes like ramen and taiyaki. 
The bento meals from convenience stores were especially memorable for their taste and convenience during my busy schedule.

My journey to Japan began with a flight from Pudong International Airport to Kansai International Airport, followed by a smooth train ride to Kyoto.
I returned to China via the same route.
